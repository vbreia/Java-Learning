# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Java Studies

[Leia em português](./README-PTBR.md)

This repository contains my studies and exercises for the **Object-Oriented Programming** course at university, implemented in **Java**.

## 📚 Course Overview

This collection represents my journey through learning fundamental OOP concepts and advanced Java programming techniques. Each module contains practical examples, exercises, and detailed notes covering essential programming paradigms.

**📝 Language Learning Note**: As a Brazilian Software Engineer student, I'm taking advantage of this opportunity to practice and improve my English skills by writing all documentation, comments, and notes in English. This dual approach allows me to strengthen both my programming abilities and English proficiency simultaneously - two essential skills for any developer in today's global tech industry.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master the principles of Object-Oriented Programming
- Understand Java syntax and best practices
- Implement classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Develop problem-solving skills through hands-on coding exercises
- Improve technical English vocabulary and documentation skills

## 📋 Course Modules

### Module 1 - Classes and Objects

- **[📖 Study Notes](./m1-class_and_objects/README.md)**
- **Topic**: Introduction to classes, objects, constructors, and methods
- **Examples**: Student class implementations with different approaches

### Module 2 - Inheritance and Polymorphism

- **[📖 Study Notes](./m2-inheritance_and_polymorphism/README.md)**
- **Topic**: Understanding inheritance hierarchies and polymorphic behavior
- **Examples**: Advanced OOP concepts and design patterns

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java
- **IDE**: VS Code
- **Compiler**: OpenJDK
