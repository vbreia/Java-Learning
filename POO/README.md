# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - College Studies

[Leia em português](./README-PTBR.md)

This directory contains all my **Object-Oriented Programming** studies and exercises completed during college classes, implemented in **Java**.

## 📚 Overview

This collection represents my learning journey through the fundamental concepts of OOP and advanced Java programming techniques. Each module contains practical examples, exercises, and detailed notes covering essential programming paradigms.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master the principles of Object-Oriented Programming
- Understand Java syntax and best practices
- Implement classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Develop problem-solving skills through practical exercises
- Apply OOP concepts in real-world projects

## 📋 Repository Contents

### 📁 [Introduction of OOP in java](./Introduction-of-OOP-in-java/)

Organized OOP study modules:

- **[Module 1 - Classes and Objects](./Introduction-of-OOP-in-java/m1-class_and_objects/)**: Introduction to classes, objects, constructors, and methods
- **[Module 2 - Inheritance and Polymorphism](./Introduction-of-OOP-in-java/m2-inheritance_and_polymorphism/)**: Advanced OOP concepts and design patterns

### 📄 Exercise Files

- `Escola/Principal.java` - School management and student grouping by naturalidade

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java
- **IDE**: VS Code
- **Compiler**: OpenJDK

## 🚀 How to Run

To run the school management program (`Escola/Principal.java`):

```bash
# From the root of the repository

# Compile all files in the Escola package, generating the correct package structure
javac -d POO POO/Escola/*.java

# Run the main program
java -cp POO POO.Escola.Principal
```

To run any other Java file in this repository:

```bash
# Navigate to the specific directory
cd POO/

# Compile the Java file
javac FileName.java

# Run the compiled program
java FileName
```
