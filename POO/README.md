# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - College Studies

[Leia em português](./README-PTBR.md)

This directory contains all my **Object-Oriented Programming** studies and exercises completed during college classes, implemented in **Java**.

## 📚 Overview

This collection represents my learning journey through the fundamental concepts of OOP and advanced Java programming techniques. Each module contains practical examples, exercises, and detailed notes covering essential programming paradigms.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master the principles of Object-Oriented Programming
- Understand Java syntax and best practices
- Implement classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Develop problem-solving skills through practical exercises
- Apply OOP concepts in real-world projects

## 📋 Repository Contents
